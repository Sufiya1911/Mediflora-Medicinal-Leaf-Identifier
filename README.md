# Project Mediflora Web App 

Team mediflora noticed that the knowledge among the general public about ayurvedic medicinal plants is less nowadays and because of that the indigenous medicinal system has been neglected. The main reason was, there wasn't any easy way to identify ayurvedic medicinal plants by the general public. So Mediflora web based application is introduced to solve the above problem where team mediflora has developed an automated system to identify ayurvedic medicinal plants by scanning the leaves of that plant and gives its respective medicinal properties.
